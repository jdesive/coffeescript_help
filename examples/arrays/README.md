# Arrays
The CoffeeScript literals for objects and arrays look very similar to their JavaScript cousins. When each property is 
listed on its own line, the commas are optional.

```coffeescript
array = ["one", "two", "three"]
arrayInt = [1, 2, 3]
```

```coffeescript
array = {val1: "value1", val2: "value2"}
```

```coffeescript
bitlist = [
  1, 0, 1
  0, 0, 1
  1, 1, 0
]
```
